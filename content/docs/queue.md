The Task Queue allows you to change the order in which the tools you previous selected are ran. Some operations may depend on another task. For example, if you want to add a sub-list, you must first add the parent list. The sub list has to find the parent list to insert the sub-list (child list). However, most tools will not require any special order.

Tasks can be rearranged with the arrows. Each task can be manually ran or deleted. You can mark a task as complete to skip running it later. You can also mark all the tasks as complete or incomplete.

Mosts tasks display information related to the tool you chose. These can help with identification if you used multiple instances of a tool.
