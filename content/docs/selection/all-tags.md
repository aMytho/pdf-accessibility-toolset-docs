The All-Tags selection will target every tag in the document. However, there are a few things to be aware of.

1. The [Limit](/docs/selection/limit) will not limit this selection.
2. If you are inserting a tag before or after the selection, the document root will not be included. This is because you cannot add anything before or after the root element.
3. Non-tagged content will not be affected.
