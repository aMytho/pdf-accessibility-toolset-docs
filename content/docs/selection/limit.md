Many selections will target more than one element. If this is the case, consider adding a limit. The selection will target each element. If the next element is more than the limit placed, the selection will stop.

You can use the Check Matches button in the interface to see the amount of tags that were targeted. This **includes the limit**! If you want to see all of the tags that match a selection regardless of the limit, set the limit to its max value of 999.
