This selection allows you to target a type of tag. This selection is commonly used for:

- Selecting every *figure* tag to add alt text.
- Selecting every *h6* to add a new tag below each section of the document.
- Selecting a tag that only appears once.
- Selecting every instance of a tag.

This selection will likely have multiple targets. Use the [limit selection](/docs/selection/limit "Limiting Selection") feature accordingly.
