The Accessibility Toolset is not a replacement for Adobe Acrobat or any other PDF editor. Instead, it serves to automate repetitive parts of the accessibility process. Every user will have their own, unique workflow.

Once you are ready for the toolset, you can follow the below steps to fix accessibility issues.

- [Import the PDF](/docs/import)
- Modify the PDF using a [tool(s)](/docs/tools)
- - Use the [Selection Suite](/docs/selection) to target specific tags
- Change the order of pending operations via the [Queued Tasks](/docs/queue)
- Export the PDF
